		      <div class="panel-body">For my software engineering class (Fall 2018), one of our projects was
         to build a zombie simulation. This project's aim was to reinforce object-
         oriented design principals and to get familiar with using GUI's. The
          project involved creating human and zombie objects and giving them rules
          and properties. Then, I updated the window with each iteration of the
          code, making sure the simulation responded to user input. For example,
          hitting space bar resets the simulation and clicking on the screen adds
          a zombie in that spot. The finished code is on my GitHub repository,

		      <div class="panel-body">The last project in my software engineering class (Fall 2018) was to
            create a multi-user chat server. This project's aim was to teach us how
             networking and threading work. I created a server and a client, running
              as many clients as I wanted at a time, using some starter code from the
            profesor. The goal was for each client to connect with a name of their
            choice. If they wanted to change their name, they typed "./" then the desired
            name, which updates that user's name in their own window and all other client's
            windows. The server read in each message from any of the clients and then sent
            it back to all the clients along with the name of that client. Each client
            printed a running log of all the messages sent. The code is

		      <div class="panel-body">In my Computer Architecture class (Fall 2018), I worked with a group to
            design a processor for a simplified version of LC-3. We built every component,
          including the memory, control, and processing units. I was responsible for the
        processing unit, so I made the ALU and register bank from scratch and connected
        them to the rest of the machine. We used Cedar Logic to design, build, and test.</div>

		      <div class="panel-body">Our next project in Computer Architecture was to write encryption software
        in LC-3. The program ran by prompting the user to select whether they wanted
        to encrypt, decrypt, or exit. If they chose to encrypt, they entered a message,
        then entered a key. The program used two encryption algorithms to convert each
        character of the message, then stored those in memory. Then, if the user chose
        to decrypt, the user would again enter the same key. The program reversed the
        encryption to print out the original message. If the user chose to exit the
        program, the program wrote over the section of memory that stored the encrypted
        message, just to be safe.</div>

		      <div class="panel-body">In Computer Architecture, the next project was to build a search engine in C.
          The program read in data from three text files and placed the data in a hashmap.
          Next, the program removed all stop words from the map. The user entered a string
          of words to search for, and the program calculated and used the inverse document
          frequency to rank the documents by relevance and printed that ordering to the
          screen. Code is <a class="active" href="https://github.com/allisonrobbins/project-5-arch">here</a>.</div>

		      <div class="panel-body">Given image altering code in C, this project was to optimize the code's performance.
        Because this project was in my Computer Architecture class, the goal was not to create
        nice, readable, object oriented code. Rather, it was to reduce the time needed to rotate
        and smooth an image. By using inlining and blocking, I reduced the time by 60%. Code is uploaded
